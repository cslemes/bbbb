## Installation

### Standard Installation

   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```
5. Build the project:
   ```
   go build -o bbbb main.go
   ```

### Docker Installation

Bubble Blog comes with a Dockerfile for easy containerization and deployment. Here's how to use it:

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cslemes/bbbb.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd bbbb
   ```
4. Build the Docker image:

   ```
5. Run the container:
   ```
   docker run -p 42069:42069 bubble-blog
   ```

## Configuration

Bubble Blog uses a `config.yaml` file for configuration. Here's an explanation of the configuration options:

```yaml
server:
  host: 0.0.0.0  # The IP address to bind the server to (0.0.0.0 allows connections from any IP)
  port: 42069    # The port number for the SSH server

theme:
  color: special # The color theme to use. Options: subtle, highlight, special

navigation:
  showingSplash: true # Whether to show the splash screen on startup
```

You can customize these settings to change the server's binding address and port, adjust the color theme, and control whether the splash screen is displayed on startup.

## Content Management

Bubble Blog uses a file-based content management system. Blog posts are stored as Markdown files in the `posts` directory. Here's how it works:

- Each blog post is a separate Markdown file in the `posts` directory.
- The filename (without the `.md` extension) is used as the post's identifier.
- The content of the Markdown file is rendered and displayed in the blog.

To add a new blog post:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `posts` directory.
2. Name the file descriptively, e.g., `my-first-blog-post.md`.
3. Write your blog post content in Markdown format.
4. Save the file, and it will automatically appear in your Bubble Blog.

## Usage

1. Start the Bubble Blog server:
   ```
   ./bbbb
   ```
2. Connect to the server using SSH:
   ```
   ssh localhost -p 42069  # Or the port you specified in config.yaml
   ```
3. Navigate through the blog using the keyboard:
   - Use arrow keys or `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to move around
   - Press `Enter` to select
   - Use `q` or `Ctrl+C` to quit
